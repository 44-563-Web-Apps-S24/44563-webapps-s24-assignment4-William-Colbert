        <p>LOMOV: Mine!

            NATALYA STEPANOVNA: It's not true! I'll prove it! I'll send my mowers out to the Meadows this very day!
            
            LOMOV: What?
            
            NATALYA STEPANOVNA: My mowers will be there this very day!
            
            LOMOV: I'll give it to them in the neck!
            
            NATALYA STEPANOVNA: You dare!
            
            LOMOV: [Clutches at his heart] Oxen Meadows are mine! You understand? Mine!
            
            NATALYA STEPANOVNA: Please don't shout! You can shout yourself hoarse in your own house, but here I must ask you to restrain yourself!</p>
